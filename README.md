# mcp-server-motherduck MCP server

An [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for MotherDuck and local DuckDB.

## Components

### Prompts

The server provides one prompt:

- duckdb-motherduck-prompt: A prompt to initialize a connection to duckdb or motherduck and start working with it

### Tools

The server offers one tool:

- query: Execute a query on the MotherDuck (DuckDB) database
  - Takes "query" as required string arguments

This is because all the interactions with both the DuckDB and MotherDuck are done through writing SQL queries.

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add the snippet below to your Claude Desktop config and make sure to set the HOME var to your home folder (needed by DuckDB).

When using MotherDuck, you also need to set a [MotherDuck token](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/authenticating-and-connecting-to-motherduck/authenticating-to-motherduck/#storing-the-access-token-as-an-environment-variable) env var.

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
