## Features

- **Hybrid execution**: query data from local DuckDB or/and cloud-based MotherDuck databases
- **Cloud storage integration**: access data stored in Amazon S3 or other cloud storage thanks to MotherDuck's integrations
- **Data sharing**: create and share databases
- **SQL analytics**: use DuckDB's SQL dialect to query any size of data directly from your AI Assistant or IDE
- **Serverless architecture**: run analytics without needing to configure instances or clusters

## Components

### Prompts

The server provides one prompt:

- `duckdb-motherduck-initial-prompt`: A prompt to initialize a connection to DuckDB or MotherDuck and start working with it

### Tools

The server offers one tool:

- `query`: Execute a SQL query on the DuckDB or MotherDuck database
  - **Inputs**:
    - `query` (string, required): The SQL query to execute

All interactions with both DuckDB and MotherDuck are done through writing SQL queries.

## Command Line Parameters

The MCP server supports the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--transport` | Choice | `stdio` | Transport type. Options: `stdio`, `sse`, `stream` |
| `--port` | Integer | `8000` | Port to listen on for sse and stream transport mode |
| `--db-path` | String | `md:` | Path to local DuckDB database file or MotherDuck database |
| `--motherduck-token` | String | `None` | Access token to use for MotherDuck database connections (uses `motherduck_token` env var by default) |
| `--read-only` | Flag | `False` | Flag for connecting to DuckDB in read-only mode. Only supported for local DuckDB databases. Uses short-lived connections for concurrent access |
| `--home-dir` | String | `None` | Home directory for DuckDB (uses `HOME` env var by default) |
| `--saas-mode` | Flag | `False` | Flag for connecting to MotherDuck in SaaS mode |

uvx mcp-server-motherduck --transport stream --db-path /path/to/local.db --read-only

# Connect to MotherDuck with token with stream transport mode
uvx mcp-server-motherduck --transport stream --db-path md: --motherduck-token YOUR_TOKEN

# Connect to local DuckDB file in read-only mode with stream transport mode
uvx mcp-server-motherduck --transport stream --db-path /path/to/local.db --read-only

# Connect to MotherDuck in SaaS mode for enhanced security with stream transport mode
uvx mcp-server-motherduck --transport stream --db-path md: --motherduck-token YOUR_TOKEN --saas-mode
```

## Getting Started

### General Prerequisites

- `uv` installed, you can install it using `pip install uv` or `brew install uv`

If you plan to use the MCP with Claude Desktop or any other MCP comptabile client, the client need to be installed.

### Prerequisites for DuckDB

- No prerequisites. The MCP server can create an in-memory database on-the-fly
- Or connect to an existing local DuckDB database file , or one stored on remote object storage (e.g., AWS S3).

See [Connect to local DuckDB](#connect-to-local-duckdb).

### Prerequisites for MotherDuck

- Sign up for a [MotherDuck account](https://app.motherduck.com/?auth_flow=signup)
- Generate an access token via the [MotherDuck UI](https://app.motherduck.com/settings/tokens?auth_flow=signup)
- Store the token securely for use in the configuration

### Usage with Cursor

1. Install Cursor from [cursor.com/downloads](https://www.cursor.com/downloads) if you haven't already

2. Open Cursor:

- To set it up globally for the first time, go to Settings->MCP and click on "+ Add new global MCP server".
- This will open a `mcp.json` file to which you add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-motherduck": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-motherduck",
        "--db-path",
        "md:",
        "--motherduck-token",
        "<YOUR_MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN_HERE>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Manual Installation

Add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "motherduck_token",
        "description": "MotherDuck Token",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "motherduck": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": [
          "mcp-server-motherduck",
          "--db-path",
          "md:",
          "--motherduck-token",
          "${input:motherduck_token}"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "motherduck_token",
      "description": "MotherDuck Token",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "motherduck": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-motherduck",
        "--db-path",
        "md:",
        "--motherduck-token",
        "${input:motherduck_token}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage with Claude Desktop

1. Install Claude Desktop from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download) if you haven't already

2. Open the Claude Desktop configuration file:

- To quickly access it or create it the first time, open the Claude Desktop app, select Settings, and click on the "Developer" tab, finally click on the "Edit Config" button.
- Add the following configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-motherduck": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-motherduck",
        "--db-path",
        "md:",
        "--motherduck-token",
        "<YOUR_MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN_HERE>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Notes**:

- Replace `YOUR_MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual MotherDuck token
- The `HOME` environment variable is required for DuckDB to function properly.

## Securing your MCP Server when querying MotherDuck

If the MCP server is exposed to third parties and should only have read access to data, we recommend using a read scaling token and running the MCP server in SaaS mode.

**Read Scaling Tokens** are special access tokens that enable scalable read operations by allowing up to 4 concurrent read replicas, improving performance for multiple end users while *restricting write capabilities*.
Refer to the [Read Scaling documentation](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/authenticating-and-connecting-to-motherduck/read-scaling/#creating-a-read-scaling-token) to learn how to create a read-scaling token.

**SaaS Mode** in MotherDuck enhances security by restricting it's access to local files, databases, extensions, and configurations, making it ideal for third-party tools that require stricter environment protection. Learn more about it in the [SaaS Mode documentation](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/authenticating-and-connecting-to-motherduck/authenticating-to-motherduck/#authentication-using-saas-mode).

**Secure Configuration**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-motherduck": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-motherduck",
        "--db-path",
        "md:",
        "--motherduck-token",
        "<YOUR_READ_SCALING_TOKEN_HERE>",
        "--saas-mode"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Connect to local DuckDB

To connect to a local DuckDB, instead of using the MotherDuck token, specify the path to your local DuckDB database file or use `:memory:` for an in-memory database.

In-memory database:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-motherduck": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-motherduck",
        "--db-path",
        ":memory:"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Local DuckDB file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-motherduck": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-motherduck",
        "--db-path",
        "/path/to/your/local.db"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Local DuckDB file in [readonly mode](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/connect/concurrency.html):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-motherduck": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-motherduck",
        "--db-path",
        "/path/to/your/local.db",
        "--read-only"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: readonly mode for local file-backed DuckDB connections also makes use of
short lived connections. Each time the query MCP tool is used a temporary,
reaodnly connection is created + query is executed + connection is closed. This
feature was motivated by a workflow where [DBT](https://www.getdbt.com) was for
modeling data within duckdb and then an MCP client (Windsurf/Cline/Claude/Cursor)
was used for exploring the database. The short lived connections allow each tool
to run and then release their connection, allowing the next tool to connect.

## Example Queries

Once configured, you can e.g. ask Claude to run queries like:

- "Create a new database and table in MotherDuck"
- "Query data from my local CSV file"
- "Join data from my local DuckDB database with a table in MotherDuck"
- "Analyze data stored in Amazon S3"

## Running in SSE mode

The server can run in SSE mode in two ways:

### Direct SSE mode

Run the server directly in SSE mode using the `--transport sse` flag:

```bash
uvx mcp-server-motherduck --transport sse --port 8000 --db-path md: --motherduck-token <your_motherduck_token>
```

This will start the server listening on the specified port (default 8000) and you can point your clients directly to this endpoint.

### Using supergateway

Alternatively, you can run SSE mode using `supergateway`:

```bash
npx -y supergateway --stdio "uvx mcp-server-motherduck --db-path md: --motherduck-token <your_motherduck_token>"
```

Both methods allow you to point your clients such as Claude Desktop, Cursor to the SSE endpoint.

## Development configuration

To run the server from a local development environment, use the following configuration:

```json
 {
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-motherduck": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/your/local/mcp-server-motherduck",
        "run",
        "mcp-server-motherduck",
        "--db-path",
        "md:",
        "--motherduck-token",
        "<YOUR_MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN_HERE>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter connection issues, verify your MotherDuck token is correct
- For local file access problems, ensure the `--home-dir` parameter is set correctly
- Check that the `uvx` command is available in your PATH
- If you encounter [`spawn uvx ENOENT`](https://github.com/motherduckdb/mcp-server-motherduck/issues/6) errors, try specifying the full path to `uvx` (output of `which uvx`)
- In version previous for v0.4.0 we used environment variables, now we use parameters
